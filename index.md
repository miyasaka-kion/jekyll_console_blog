INFO: Please note that our website is currently undergoing construction as we work on translating and transferring its resources.


# Introduction 
The website will be an extension and continuation of my existing [blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/kion), primarily dedicated to documenting content related to C++ and software development. After all, being not a frontend developer, I created this website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, allowing me to focus on my content creation rather than something else.
