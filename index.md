Info: The current website is under construction. Translation and the transfer of website resources is in progress.


# Introduction 
The website will be a continuation of my existing tech blog, primarily dedicated to documenting content related to C++ and software development. After all, I'm not a frontend engineer, and I happen to be an ASCII enthusiast—so I created this website.
